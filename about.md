## Our Story

Born2Fly was founded with a simple belief: **every child deserves the joy of movement** and the confidence that comes from discovering what they can do.

We bring Pre-School & Adaptive Gymnastics directly to schools across KwaZulu-Natal, working with children of all abilities. Our programmes are designed for children aged 3 and up, introducing students to gymnastics and physical fitness in an inclusive environment.

**Our Commitment**: All Born2Fly coaches are qualified professionals with international and specialized certifications, including [Gymnastics SA](https://gymnasticssa.co.za/) certification. Our coaches are background checked, First Aid trained, and specialists in adaptive coaching who are passionate about every child's potential. We adhere to strict safety standards, ensuring a secure and positive environment for your child's development.

Gymnastics is the basis of all sports and provides a wonderful foundation for all activities, helping to develop strength, flexibility, coordination, and physical fitness. Our programmes focus on what children CAN do, not what they can't.

Born2Fly is proud to be associated with [Pinetown Gymnastics](https://www.ptngym.co.za/), bringing excellence in gymnastics education to schools across KwaZulu-Natal.

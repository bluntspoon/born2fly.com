## Our Story

Born2Fly was founded with a simple belief: **every child deserves the joy of movement** and the confidence that comes from discovering what they can do.

We bring Pre-School & Adaptive Gymnastics directly to schools across KwaZulu-Natal, working with children of all abilities. Our programs are designed for children aged 3 to 6 years and introduce students to gymnastics and physical fitness in an inclusive environment. The programme is specifically adapted for children with special needs.

Our programs focus on what children CAN do, not what they can't. Gymnastics is the basis of sports and provides a wonderful foundation for all activities, helping to develop strength, flexibility, coordination, and physical fitness.

## Therapeutic Benefits

Born2Fly proudly caters for children with special needs and has many years of experience working with children of all abilities. These activities are ideal for children requiring Occupational Therapy (OT).

Children are encouraged to participate in activities with fun presentation and the camaraderie of their fellow pupils. All activities are presented in a fun and safe manner, supporting children's physical and emotional development.

Coach Moses has personally trained and taken Charles Phillips to compete at the international level. Charles achieved 2 medals at the Trisome Games (down syndrome multi-code games) in Turkey - Gold for his parallel bar final routine and bronze for his horizontal bar routine in the T21 senior men's division. This achievement showcases our commitment to empowering children with special needs to reach their full potential.
